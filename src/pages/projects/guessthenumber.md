Simple game where you guess a number between 1 and 100. When the number is bigger than the card you pick, the card turn green and when the number is smaller than the one you pick then the card will turn red. If you got it right then it will turn yellow.

Inspired by a physical version of the game made by Rui Gon√ßalo Espadeiro.
