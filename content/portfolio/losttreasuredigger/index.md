Treasures are hidden around the map, you have a scanner to help find those treasures. If you find them all you win, however, you can't just dig everything. You have a number of how many blocks you can dig, if you find a treasure you can dig 50 more, so you have to plan out how you want to dig. You can only dig down, left or right. You can't dig up, so if you dig straight down there's an high chance you will get stuck.
